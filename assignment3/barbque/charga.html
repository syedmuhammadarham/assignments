    <p><i><b>Charagh is a deep-fried chicken dish from Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The term Charagh is a Pashto (of the
                Pashtun people) language term meaning "chicken". The dish is widely popular throughout Pakistan. The
                whole chicken is marinated overnight in the refrigerator with sauce made of spices mixed with yoghurt,
                with horizontal cuts through the chicken in order to infuse the flavors. The marinated chicken is first
                steamed until tender and then fried in oil to gives crisp texture. The dish is typically served with
                naan or roti bread, and a side of salad or raita.</b></i></p>
