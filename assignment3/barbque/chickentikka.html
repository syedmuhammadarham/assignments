    <p><i><b>Chicken tikka is a dish of marinated, skewered, and grilled chicken. It is a popular dish in Indian cuisine
                and is often served with a side of rice or naan bread. The chicken is typically marinated in a mixture
                of yogurt, spices, and herbs. The spices used in the marinade can vary, but they often include cumin,
                coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The chicken is then skewered and grilled over high heat. The
                grilling process cooks the chicken and also helps to infuse it with the flavors of the marinade. Chicken
                tikka can be served in a variety of ways. It can be served as an appetizer, main course, or even as a
                snack. It can also be used in other dishes, such as chicken tikka masala.</b></i></p>
