                French fries are a popular side dish or snack that is made from deep-fried potatoes. They are typically
                cut into thin strips, but they can also be cut into other shapes, such as wedges or curls. French fries
                are often served with ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar. French fries originated in Belgium in the 17th
                century. They were originally made from leftover potatoes that were cut into thin strips and fried in
                oil. French fries became popular in France in the 18th century, and they were eventually introduced to
                the United States in the 19th century.</b></i></p>
