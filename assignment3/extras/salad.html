                A salad is a dish consisting of mixed, mostly natural ingredients. They are typically served chilled or
                at room temperature, though some can be served warm. The word "salad" comes to English from the French
                salade of the same meaning, itself an abbreviated form of the earlier Vulgar Latin herba salata (salted
                herb), from the Latin salata (salted), from sal (salt). In English, the word first appears as "salad" or
                "sallet" in the 14th century. Salt is associated with salad because vegetables were seasoned with brine
                (a solution of salt in water) or salty oil-and-vinegar dressings during Roman times.</b></i></p>
