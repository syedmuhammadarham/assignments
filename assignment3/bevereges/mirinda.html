                Mirinda is a citrus-flavored soft drink that is similar to Fanta. It is available in many fruit
                varieties, like orange, apple, strawberry, among others. It is part of a beverage area often referred to
                as the flavour segment, comprising carbonated and non-carbonated fruit-flavoured beverages. The orange
                flavour of Mirinda now represents the majority of Mirinda sales worldwide following a major
                repositioning of the brand towards that flavour in the early 1990s.</b></i></p>
