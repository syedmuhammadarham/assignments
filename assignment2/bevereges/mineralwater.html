                Mineral water is water that comes from a natural spring and contains various minerals, such as salts and
                sulfur compounds. Mineral water may usually be still or sparkling (carbonated/effervescent) according to
                the presence or absence of added gases. The more calcium and magnesium ions that are dissolved in water,
                the harder it is said to be; water with few dissolved calcium and magnesium ions is described as being
                soft. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250
                parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS), originating from a geologically and physically protected
                underground water source. No minerals may be added to this water. In the European Union, bottled water
                may be called mineral water when it is bottled at the source and has undergone no or minimal
                treatment.</b></i></p>
