    <p><i><b>Chicken Shashlik rice is a popular Asian-inspired dish made with cooked rice, chicken, vegetables, and eggs.
                It is typically seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil, and salt and pepper. Chicken fried rice can be made
                with any type of cooked rice, but it is typically made with leftover white rice. The chicken is
                typically cooked in a wok or large skillet until it is browned and cooked through. The vegetables are
                then added and cooked until they are softened. The eggs are scrambled and added to the pan, and then the
                rice is added and everything is stir-fried until it is heated through and combined. Chicken fried rice
                is typically served hot with soy sauce on the side.</b></i></p>
