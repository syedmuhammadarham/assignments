    <p><i><b>Seekh kabab is a type of kebab that is made with minced meat, typically lamb or chicken, that is marinated
                in a mixture of spices and herbs. The meat is then shaped into long skewers and grilled over an open
                flame. Seekh kabab is a popular dish in many parts of the world, including South Asia, the Middle East,
                and Central Asia. The word "seekh" means " skewer" in Urdu and Hindi. The word "kabab" comes from the
                Persian word "kebab" which means "to roast". Seekh kabab is typically served with a side of rice, naan
                bread, or salad. It can also be served as an appetizer or snack.</b></i></p>
