                Mix Daal is a popular Indian dish made with black lentils, butter, cream, and spices. It is a rich
                and creamy dish that is often served with rice or naan bread. Dal makhani is a relatively modern dish,
                invented in the 1950s by Kundan Lal Gujral, a Punjabi Hindu migrant from Peshawar, Pakistan. Gujral was
                the owner of Moti Mahal, a restaurant in Delhi, India. He was looking for a way to create a vegetarian
                dish that would complement his popular butter chicken. He experimented with different ingredients and
                techniques, and eventually came up with the recipe for dal makhani. Dal makhani quickly became a popular
                dish at Moti Mahal, and it soon spread to other restaurants and households throughout India.</b></i></p>
