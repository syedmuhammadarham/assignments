<p><b><i>Chicken pulao is a rice dish made with chicken, rice, spices, and herbs. It is a popular dish in South Asia, and there are many different regional variations. The dish is typically made by cooking the chicken and rice separately, and then layering them together in a pot, along with spices and herbs, and then cooking it over low heat until the rice is cooked through, and the flavors have melded together. Chicken pulao is a hearty and flavorful dish that is perfect for a special occasion or a casual weeknight meal. It can be served with a side of raita or chutney.</i></b></p>
