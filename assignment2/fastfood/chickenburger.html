    <p><i><b>Chicken burger is a type of sandwich that consists of a patty made from ground chicken, served in a bun,
                typically hot and often with other ingredients. The chicken patty used in such a burger is typically
                formed into a patty and then grilled or fried. The bun is typically a hamburger bun, but other types of
                buns, such as Kaiser rolls or brioche buns, may also be used. Other ingredients that may be used in a
                chicken burger include lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard. Chicken burgers
                are often served with fries or onion rings as a side dish.</b></i></p>
