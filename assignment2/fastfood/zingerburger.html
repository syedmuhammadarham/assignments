    <p><i><b>A Zinger burger is a type of chicken burger that is made with a spicy, battered chicken patty. It was first
                introduced by KFC in the United Kingdom in 1996, and it has since become a popular menu item around the
                world. The Zinger burger is made with a chicken breast that is coated in a batter made with spices,
                herbs, and flour. The chicken is then deep-fried until it is golden brown and crispy. The chicken patty
                is then placed on a bun and topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and a special Zinger sauce.</b></i></p>
