<h1 style="color: aquamarine;" align="center">Saylani Mass IT Training Programs</h1>

<p style="color: cornflowerblue;">Saylani Mass IT Training Program is a vocational training program run by the Saylani Welfare International Trust, a non-profit organization based in Karachi, Pakistan. The program offers free IT education to students who cannot afford it.</p>

<p style="color: cornflowerblue;">Living in an era driven by information technology makes us investing in our youth through computer programing education necessary. Saylani's vision is to make Pakistan a Global Software Development Hub with the brightest I.T. minds. We want to empower our youth to think, create and change the software world. Saylani launched its Saylani Mass I.T. (SMIT) Program to achieve this goal. <b>SMIT offers expert training in Mobile and web application development, CCNA, graphic designing, computer-based accountancy etc</b>. With hundreds of students currently enrolled with SMIT, we aim to produce skilled software developers nationally. <i>Not only will this generate numerous jobs, but it will also inadvertently boost our annual GDP</i>.</p>
