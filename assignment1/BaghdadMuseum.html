<h1 style="color: brown;" align="center">Baghdad Museum</h1>

<p style="color: blue;"><i>The looting of Baghdad's Iraqi Museum is deemed to be one of the worst things that happened during the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003</i>. The event caused immeasurable damage to the integrity of Iraqis, and the mutual history of our origin. However, despite the chaos, the combined efforts of the Iraqis soldiers to recover the lost and stolen artifacts deserve recognition, as they portray many reasons why preserving the world's origin history is essential. The main reasons why it is significant to recover the artifacts include: preserving cultural identity, protecting global heritage, and preventing irreparable loss.</p>

<p style="color: blue;">Preserving cultural identity is very important when it comes to anything regarding history. Cultural heritage is what embodies the history, traditions, and identity of a nation or community. It serves as a reminder and path of our shared human experience. Without it, history ceases to exist entirely, which leads to many problems, including the forgery of historical events, delusions about non-existing people, and uneducated people. In times of conflict, when it seems as if there are more important things to focus on and protect, preserving cultural heritage becomes paramount. As Donny George Youkhanna stated, <b><q>Every single item that was lost from the museum is a great loss for humanity.</q></b> Recovering stolen and damaged items helps to recover and remember the history of one's nation and ensures the survival of its cultural identity.</p>
